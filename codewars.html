<h3>Find the first non-consecutive number</h3>
<p class="problem">Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

    By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

    E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

    If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

    The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too! </p>
<div class="answer">
    <p> function firstNonConsecutive (arr) { <br>
        for (let i=0; i < arr.length -1; i++) { <br>
        // the for loop, loops through the numbers <br>
        let curr = arr[i]; <br>
        let next = arr[i + 1]; <br>
        // create two var one for the current loop and the other one to find the number that skips <br>
        if (curr + 1 !== next) { <br>
        //if the current loop [1-8] is not != to the next loop [ 1,2,3,5]<br>
        return next; <br>
        } <br>
        } <br>
        return null; <br>
        } </p>

<h3>Simple Fun #1: Seats in Theater</h3>
<p class="problem">Your friend advised you to see a new performance in the most popular theater in the city. He knows a lot about art and his advice is usually good, but not this time: the performance turned out to be awfully dull. It's so bad you want to sneak out, which is quite simple, especially since the exit is located right behind your row to the left. All you need to do is climb over your seat and make your way to the exit.<br>
    The main problem is your shyness: you're afraid that you'll end up blocking the view (even if only for a couple of seconds) of all the people who sit behind you and in your column or the columns to your left. To gain some courage, you decide to calculate the number of such people and see if you can possibly make it to the exit without disturbing too many people.<br>
    Given the total number of rows and columns in the theater (nRows and nCols, respectively), and the row and column you're sitting in, return the number of people who sit strictly behind you and in your column or to the left, assuming all seats are occupied.<br>
   <strong> Example
       For nCols = 16, nRows = 11, col = 5 and row = 3, the output should be <br>
       seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) === 96
   </strong></p>

    <div class="answer fixed" >
        <p>function seatsInTheater(nCols, nRows, col, row) { <br>
            return (nCols - col + 1) * (nRows - row); <br>
            <br>
            }</p>

<h3>Grasshopper - Check for factor</h3>
<p class="problem">This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.<br>
    Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.<br>
    About factors, Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number. 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6
      <br>
    You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor. <br>
    You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder<br>
    For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1
   <br>
    Note: base is a non-negative number, factor is a positive number.</p>
    <div class="answer">
        <p> function checkForFactor (base, factor) { <br>
            if (base % factor === 0) { <br>
            return true <br>
            } else { <br>
            return false; <br>
            }  <br>
            }   <br> or <br>
            function checkForFactor (base, factor) { <br>
            return base % factor === 0; <br>
            }</p>

<h3>Reversed Words</h3>
<p class="problem"> Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.<br>
    Example(Input --> Output): <br>
    "The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"
</p>
<div class="answer">
    <p>function reverseWords(str){ <br>
    let splitString = str.split(" "); <br>
    let reverseArray = splitString.reverse(); <br>
    let joinArray = reverseArray.join(" "); <br>
        return joinArray; <br>
    } <br>

    intructions :  <br>
        // Step 1 use the split() method to return the new array <br>
        // Step 2. Use the reverse() method to reverse the new created array <br>
        // Step 3. Use the join() method to join all elements of the array into <br>
        // Step 4. Retrun the reverse string <br>
        return joinArray; // reverse those words <br>
        or <br>
        function reverseWords(str){ <br>
        return str.split(' ').reverse().join(' '); <br>
        }
